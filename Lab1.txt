1. We?re using git as our versioning system for iOS and Android projects. What is git, and what makes it
different to other versioning systems?

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system. What makes Git different from other versioning
systems is its branching model. This allows the users to have multiple local branches independent of each other,
which in turn allows for Frictionless Context Switching, Role-Based Codelines, Feature Based Workflow and
Disposable experimentation.


2. What is a branch? When is it the right time to create a branch?

A branch is a lightweight movable pointer to a commit. A branch by default (in Git) is refered to as a master,
which points to the last commit you made, when you make new commits, it moves forward automatically.

Branches useful when you need to diverge your work from your current version to hotfix a a previous version which
can then be merged to your most recent version once fixed.


3. If you?ve forgotten to setup a git repository in the IDE, what is the command to create a git repository
and add all created files

	git init
	git add *.c
	git add README
	git commit -m 'initial project version'

4. Sometimes you don?t want to include all files in a repository, how do you avoid this?

You can create file listing patterns to match said files name .gitignore
	e.g. cat .gitignore
	     *.[oa] (ignore any files ending in .o or .a)
	     

5. Once you?ve made changes to a file/s, what?s the command to save these into the repository? When is
it recommended that you do this?

git commit
